At the start, player A chooses integers x and N with 1 ≤ x ≤ N, keeps x secret, and tells N to player B. Player B asks questions of the following type: he specifies a set S of positive integers and asks whether x belongs to S. Player A must answer yes or no, but may lie arbitrarily, subject to the restriction that among any k + 1 consecutive answers, at least one is truthful.\n\nAfter asking questions, player B specifies a set X of at most n positive integers. If x ∈ X, then B wins; otherwise, B loses.\n\nProve that:\n(1) If n ≥ 2^k, then B can guarantee a win.\n(2) For all sufficiently large k, there exists an integer n ≥ 1.99^k such that B cannot guarantee a win.",
