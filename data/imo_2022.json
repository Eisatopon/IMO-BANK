Marianne has n aluminium coins and n bronze coins, arranged in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A chain is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer k ≤ 2n, Marianne repeatedly performs the following operation: she identifies the longest chain containing the k-th coin from the left, and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row.\n\nFor example, if n = 4 and k = 4, the process starting from the ordering AABBBABA would be\n\nAABBBABA → BBBAAABA → AAABBBBA → BBBBAAAA → BBBBAAAA → · · · .\n\nFind all pairs (n, k) with 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost n coins will all be of the same type.",
